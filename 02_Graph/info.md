# Comprehensive LLM-based Course and Q&A Generation System with Quality and content control

## 1. Data Preprocessing

### 1.1 Book Selection
- Choose a high-quality, fact-based book (e.g., "For Dummies" series, "Finance Made Easy")
- Criteria:
  - Clear structure
  - Fact-dense content
  - Beginner-friendly explanations

### 1.2 Text Extraction
- Use PDF parsing libraries (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfminer)
- Extract text chapter-wise
- Preserve chapter structure and headings

### 1.3 Text Processing
- Convert extracted text into a standard format
- Options for subunit division:
  a. Page-wise: Split text by page numbers
  b. Topic-wise: Use NLP techniques to identify topic bo
- Options for subunit division:
- Options for subunit division:undaries
  c. Sentence-wise: Split text into individual sentences
  d. N-sentence chunks: Group fixed numbers of sentences (e.g., every 5 sentences)

### 1.4 Segmentation
- Divide processed text into manageable segments
- Ensure each segment contains coherent information
- Assign unique identifiers to each segment

Example segment JSON structure:
```json
{
  "segment_id": "chapter1_segment3",
  "content": "This is the content of the segment...",
  "metadata": {
    "chapter": 1,
    "page_range": [5, 7],
    "topic": "Introduction to Finance",
    "subunit_type": "topic_wise"
  }
}
```

## 2. Generating Coursework Data and Q&A

### 2.1 LLM Instruction Set
Define clear instructions for the LLM to generate various types of content:

a. Generate major topics
b. Create questions (1-10) covering all concepts
c. Produce questions in specific formats (MCQ, drag-and-drop, match the following, fill in the blanks)
d. Generate a pointwise summary

Example LLM instruction:
```
System: You are an AI course content generator. For the given text segment, create the following:
1. List of major topics (max 5)
2. Generate 5-10 questions covering key concepts in various formats (MCQ, drag-and-drop, match the following, fill in the blanks)
3. Provide a brief pointwise summary (3-5 points)

Use the specified JSON formats for all outputs. Ensure diversity in question types and maintain a balance between difficulty levels.

User: Here's a segment from Chapter 1 of "Finance Made Easy":
[SEGMENT_CONTENT]

Generate the course content as instructed.
```

### 2.2 Content Generation
Process each segment to create:
- Major topics
- Questions (various formats)
- Summary
- Concepts and notes

#### 2.2.1 Major Topics JSON Format
```json
{
  "major_topics": [
    "Introduction to Financial Markets",
    "Types of Financial Instruments",
    "Role of Central Banks",
    "Basics of Investment Strategies",
    "Understanding Risk and Return"
  ]
}
```

#### 2.2.2 Questions JSON Format
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {

      "question": "Match the financial term with its correct definition:",
      "items": [
        {"term": "Stock", "definition": "Ownership share in a company"},
        {"term": "Bond", "definition": "Debt instrument issued by governments or corporations"},
        {"term": "Mutual Fund", "definition": "Investment vehicle pooling money from multiple investors"}
      ],
      "correct_matches": [
        {"Stock": "Ownership share in a company"},
        {"Bond": "Debt instrument issued by governments or corporations"},
        {"Mutual Fund": "Investment vehicle pooling money from multiple investors"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "match_the_following",
      "question": "Match the financial terms with their correct descriptions:",
      "terms": ["Bull Market", "Bear Market", "Dividend", "Liquidity"],
      "descriptions": [
        "A market condition where prices are rising or expected to rise",
        "A market condition where prices are falling or expected to fall",
        "A portion of a company's earnings distributed to shareholders",
        "The ease with which an asset can be converted into cash"
      ],
      "correct_matches": {

        "Dividend": "A portion of a company's earnings distributed to shareholders",
        "Liquidity": "The ease with which an asset can be converted into cash"
      }

#### 2.2.3 Summary JSON Format
```json

    "Investment strategies vary based on risk tolerance and financial goals.",
    "Understanding the relationship between risk and return is fundamental to investing."
  ]
}
```

### 2.3 Processing Segments
- Iterate through all segments
- Generate content for each segment using the LLM
- Compile generated content into coursework files

### 2.4 Output Monitoring and Refinement
- Implement a quality assessment module to evaluate LLM outputs
- Criteria for evaluation:
  - Relevance to the segment content
  - Accuracy of information
  - Diversity of question types
  - Appropriate difficulty level
  - Coherence and clarity of summaries
- If output doesn't meet quality thresholds:
  1. Adjust prompt engineering
     - Refine instructions for problematic areas
     - Provide examples of desired outputs
  3. Retry generation with updated settings
  4. If issues persist, flag for human review and manual refinement
- Continuous improvement loop:
  - Collect data on successful and unsuccessful generations
  - Use this data to fine-tune the LLM or adjust the instruction set
  - Periodically update the quality assessment criteria based on user feedback and learning outcomes

### 2.5 Standardization
- Enforce consistent JSON formats for all outputs
- Implement JSON schema validation to ensure format adherence

Example JSON schema for MCQ:
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["mcq"]},
    "question": {"type": "string"},
    "options": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {"type": "string"},
      "minItems": 2
    },
    "correct_answer": {"type": "string"}
  },
  "required": ["type", "question", "options", "correct_answer"]
}
```
